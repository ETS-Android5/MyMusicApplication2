# My Music Application

Is a Demo App written in Java to play list of music.
Each track got about 10 seconds to be listen to it and decide if user should keep listening by pressing "Keep Listening" Button or the player will go to next one.
The App designed to listen to headphone buttons as much as hardware can share recognized action to media player service.
On the end of tracks player switch to the top of list.
My Music Application use Apollo GraphQL Client that generates Java and Kotlin models from GraphQL queries. These models give you a type-safe API to work with GraphQL servers.  Apollo helps you keep your GraphQL query statements together, organized, and easy to access. 

Apollo GraphQL is designed primarily with Android in mind, but you can use it in any Java/Kotlin app. 

## Features

* Java and Kotlin code generation
* Queries, Mutations and Subscriptions
* Reflection-free parsing of responses
* HTTP cache
* Normalized cache
* File uploads
* Custom scalar types
* Support for RxJava2, RxJava3, and Coroutines

## Getting started With Apollo GraphQL ?

If you are new to GraphQL, check out [the tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/tutorial/00-introduction/) that will guide you through building an Android app using Apollo, Kotlin and coroutines.

If you'd like to add Apollo Android to an existing project:

* [Get started with Kotlin](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/essentials/get-started-kotlin) shows how to add Apollo Android to a Kotlin project.
* [Get started with Java](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/essentials/get-started-java) shows how to add Apollo Android to a Java project.
* [Get started with Multiplatform (Experimental)](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/essentials/get-started-multiplatform) shows how to add Apollo Android to a Multiplatform project. This is still under heavy development and APIs may change without warning.

## IntelliJ Plugin

The [JS Graphql IntelliJ Plugin](https://jimkyndemeyer.github.io/js-graphql-intellij-plugin/) provides auto-completion, error highlighting, and go-to-definition functionality for your `.graphql` files. You can create a [`.graphqlconfig`](https://jimkyndemeyer.github.io/js-graphql-intellij-plugin/docs/developer-guide#working-with-graphql-endpoints-and-scratch-files) file to use GraphQL scratch files to work with your schema outside product code (such as to write temporary queries to test resolvers).

## Requirements 

My Music Application runs on the following platforms:

* Android API level 21+
* JDK 8+
